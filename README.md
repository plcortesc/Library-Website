# Library-Website
ASP.NET-MVC website

This code main's purpose is to create a website to keep track of your book library. To carry out this task I have implemented the following tasks:
  -List all books
  
  -List books by category
  
  -List books by author

Both "category" and "author" listings have been asumed to be sorted when clicking on the correspondings column link of the books list.
Moreover, a "search box" has been added in order to help the user to find any book depending on the Title, Author or Category.

Assumptions:
  -SQL Server Database
  
  -MVC ASP.NET Website
  
  -Entity Framework data layer
  
  -Asynchronous data access
